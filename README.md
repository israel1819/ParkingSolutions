# Valet Parking System

A modern web application designed to streamline valet parking operations. This system provides a dedicated interface for valets to manage car parking and retrieval, and an administrative dashboard for overseeing operations and managing valet employees.

## üöÄ Features

* **User Authentication:** Secure Email/Password login and registration for both Valet and Admin roles.
* **Role-Based Access:** Distinct dashboards and functionalities based on user roles.
* **Valet Dashboard:**
    * **Car Parking:** Valets can log new cars into the system, generating unique parking IDs.
    * **Customer Communication (Simulated):**
        * Automatic message to customer 5 minutes after parking (simulated).
        * Valet can simulate customer requests for car retrieval (5, 10, 15 minutes options).
        * Automatic "Car Ready at Doorstep" message to customer when car is marked ready (simulated).
    * **Car Status Management:** Update car status (Parked, Requested, Ready, Delivered).
    * **Parking Spot Management:** Clear parking spots after car delivery.
* **Admin Dashboard:**
    * **Overview Metrics:** View total cars delivered and total valet employees.
    * **Valet Performance:** Monitor individual valet activity with daily and monthly parking charts.
    * **Employee Management:** Admins can securely add new valet employees to the system.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The application follows a client-server architecture, leveraging modern web and backend technologies:

* **Frontend:** Built with **React.js** for a dynamic and responsive user interface, styled with **Tailwind CSS**. It interacts directly with Firebase for authentication and user profiles, and with the Java Spring Boot backend for all car-related operations.
* **Backend:** A **Java Spring Boot** application serving as the core business logic. It manages car data (currently in-memory, but designed for database integration) and orchestrates simulated messaging.
* **User Management (Firebase):**
    * **Firebase Authentication:** Handles user registration, login, and session management.
    * **Firebase Firestore:** Stores user profiles (roles, employee names) associated with Firebase UIDs.
* **Messaging Service:** A backend service responsible for sending notifications. Currently, it's a `ConsoleMessageService` (prints to backend console), designed for future integration with external services like **Twilio** for real WhatsApp messaging.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get the application running locally.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (LTS version recommended) & npm (or Yarn)
* Java Development Kit (JDK 17 or higher)
* Apache Maven
* A Firebase Project (Google Cloud Project)

### 1. Firebase Project Setup

1.  **Create a Firebase Project:**
    * Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    * Click "Add project" and follow the steps to create a new project.
2.  **Enable Authentication:**
    * In your Firebase project, navigate to **Build > Authentication**.
    * Go to the "Sign-in method" tab.
    * Enable the **"Email/Password"** provider. **Ensure "Anonymous" is DISABLED.**
3.  **Set up Firestore Database:**
    * In your Firebase project, navigate to **Build > Firestore Database**.
    * Click "Create database". Choose "Start in production mode" (you'll update rules shortly). Select a location.
    * **Update Firestore Security Rules:**
        * Go to the "Rules" tab in Firestore.
        * Replace the existing rules with the content from `firestore.rules` provided in the frontend code. This ensures proper read/write access for authenticated users and role-based access for valets/admins.
        * Click "Publish".
4.  **Get Firebase Web App Configuration:**
    * In your Firebase project settings (click the gear icon next to "Project overview"), go to "Project settings".
    * Under "Your apps", click the web icon (`</>`) to "Add app to get started".
    * Follow the steps, register your app, and **copy the Firebase configuration object**. You will need this for `src/FirebaseProvider.js`.

### 2. Frontend Setup (React)

1.  **Clone the Frontend Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-frontend-repo-url> valet-parking-frontend
    cd valet-parking-frontend
    ```
    *(If you don't have a separate repo, assume your current project directory is `valet-parking-frontend`.)*
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```
3.  **Configure Firebase:**
    * Open `src/FirebaseProvider.js`.
    * **Replace the placeholder `firebaseConfig` object** with the actual configuration you copied from your Firebase Console.
    * Ensure the `appId` in `FirebaseProvider.js` and other components (`App.js`, `AdminDashboard.js`, `ReceiveCarModule.js`, `Register.js`) is set to `1:1038485808891:web:94222225baddee049e725e`.
4.  **Run the Frontend Application:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or yarn start
    ```
    The frontend will open in your browser, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.
